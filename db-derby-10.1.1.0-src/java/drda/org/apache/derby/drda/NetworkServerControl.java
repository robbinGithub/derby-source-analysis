/** 
	NetworkServerControl provides the ability to start a Network Server or 
	connect to a running Network Server to shutdown, configure or retreive 
	diagnostic information.  With the exception of ping, these commands 
	can  only be performed from the  machine on which the server is running.  
	Commands can be performed from  the command line with the following 
	arguments:

	<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>start [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>]:  This starts the network
	server on the port/host specified or on localhost, port 1527 if no
	host/port is specified and no properties are set to override the 
	defaults. By default Network Server will only listen for 
	connections from the machine on which it is running. 
	Use -h 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces or -h &lt;hostname> to listen 
	on a specific interface on a  multiple IP machine. </LI>

	<LI>shutdown [-h &lt;host>][-p &lt;portnumber>]: This shutdowns the network 	server on the host and port specified or on the local host and port 
	1527(default) if no host or port is specified.  </LI> 

	<LI>ping [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>] 
	This will test whether the Network Server is up.
	</LI>

	<LI>sysinfo [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>]:  This prints 
	classpath and version information about the Network Server, 
	the JVM and the Derby engine. 

	<LI>runtimeinfo [-h &lt;host] [-p &lt;portnumber]: This prints
	extensive debbugging information about sessions, threads, 
	prepared statements, and memory usage for the running Network Server.
	</LI>

	<LI>logconnections {on | off} [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>]:  
	This turns logging of connections and disconnections on and off.  
	Connections and disconnections are logged to derby.log. 
	Default is off.</LI>

	<LI>maxthreads &lt;max> [-h &lt;host>][-p &lt;portnumber>]:  
	This sets the maximum number of threads that can be used for connections. 
	Default 0 (unlimitted).
	</LI>

	<LI>timeslice &lt;milliseconds> [-h &lt;host>][-p &lt;portnumber>]: 
	This sets the time each session can have using a connection thread 
	before yielding to a waiting session. Default is 0 (no yeild).
	
	</LI>

	<LI>trace {on | off} [-s &lt;session id>] [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>]: 
	This turns drda tracing on or off for the specified session or if no 
	session is  specified for all sessions. Default is off</LI>


	<LI>tracedirectory &lt;tracedirectory> [-h &lt;host>] [-p &lt;portnumber>]: 
	This changes where new trace files will be placed. 
	For sessions with tracing already turned on,  
	trace files remain in the previous location. 
	Default is clousdcape.system.home</LI>

	</UL>
	<P>Properties can be set in the derby.properties file or on the command line.
	Properties on the command line take precedence over properties in the 
	derby.properties file.  Arguments on the command line take precedence
	over properties. 
	The following is a list of properties that can be set for 
	NetworkServerControl:

	<UL><LI>derby.drda.portNumber=&lt;port number>: This property 
	indicates which port should be used for the Network Server. </LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.host=&lt;host name  or ip address >: This property 
	indicates the ip address to which NetworkServerControl should connect 

	<LI>derby.drda.traceDirectory=&lt;trace directory>: This property 
	indicates where to put trace files. </LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.traceAll=true:  This property turns on tracing for
	all sessions. Default is tracing is off.</LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.logConnections=true:  This property turns on logging
	of connections and disconnections. Default is connections are not logged.</LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.minThreads=&lt;value>: If this property
	is set, the &lt;value> number of threads will be created when the Network Server is
	booted. </LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.maxThreads=&lt;value>: If this property
	is set, the &lt;value> is the maximum number of connection threads that will be 
	created.  If a session starts when there are no connection threads available
	and the maximum number of threads has been reached, it will wait until a 
	conection thread becomes available. </LI>

	<LI>derby.drda.timeSlice=&lt;milliseconds>: If this property
	is set, the connection threads will not check for waiting sessions until the
	current session has been working for &lt;milliseconds>.  
	A value of 0 causes the thread to work on the current session until the 
	session exits. If this property is not set, the default value is 0. </LI>
	
</LI>

<P><B>Examples.</B>
