/**
 * This test is part of the "largedata" suite because the use of
 * very large LOBs can require extra memory for the server JVM.
 * If this test was run as part of the normal 'derbyall' suite,
 * it would require that any developer running the derbyall suite
 * have a machine with a good deal of memory.  And since _every_
 * developer is encouraged to run 'derbyall' before submitting
 * any patches, that would mean that _every_ developer would
 * need a machine with lots of memory--and that's something we
 * do NOT want to require.
 * 
 * The specific JVM memory requirements for this test are set in the
 * properties file for this test (lobLengthTests_app.properties).
 * It started out as -mx128M -ms128M, but that could change in the
 * future as more test cases are added to this class.  If it's not
 * at least 128M, the result will be OutOfMemory exceptions when
 * running against Network Server.
