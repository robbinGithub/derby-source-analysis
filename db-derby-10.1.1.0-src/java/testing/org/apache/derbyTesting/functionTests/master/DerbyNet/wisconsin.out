ij> -- This test is an adaptation of the Wisconsin benchmark, as documented in
----- The Benchmark Handbook, Second Edition (edited by Jim Gray).  The structure
----- of the tables and the data in the tables are taken from there.
-----
----- The original benchmark talks about clustered and non-clustered
----- indexes - as far as I can tell, this really means indexes where the
----- row ordering is or is not the same as in the base table.  It does
----- not mean special types of indexes.  I am putting in queries that
----- use both ordered and unordered indexes, despite the fact that
----- our optimizer does not currently distinguish these cases.
-----
----- Another difference is that the original Wisconsin benchmark is a performance
----- test, while this test is only intended to ensure that the optimizer comes
----- up with the right query plan.  Therefore, this test doesn't include those
----- parts of the Wisconsin benchmark where the optimizer has no choice of
----- access path (e.g. single-table query with no indexes), nor does it include
----- the projection and update queries.
-----
----- This test only does the first variation of each query, since that is
----- all that is documented in The Benchmark Handbook (it wouldn't be a true
----- academic reference text if everything were spelled out).
-----
----- After the original Wisconsin queries are a bunch of queries that use the
----- Wisconsin schema but that were written at Cloudscape specifically for
----- testing our optimizer.

----- Note that after fix for optimizer bug 5868, in runtime statistics info, we will see 2 qualifiers for table TENKTUP2. This is because as fix for

----- Note that after fix for optimizer bug 5868, in runtime statistics info, we will see 2 qualifiers for table TENKTUP2. This is because as fix for
----- bug 5868, while getting rid of a redundant predicate which is a start and/or stop AND a qualifier, we mark the predicate we are going to keep 
----- as start and/or stop AND as a qualifier. Prior to fix of bug 5868, we were disregarding the qualifier flag on the redundant predicate if it
