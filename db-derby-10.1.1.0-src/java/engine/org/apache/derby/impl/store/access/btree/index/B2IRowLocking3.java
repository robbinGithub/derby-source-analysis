    /**
     * Lock key previous to first key in btree.
     * <p>
     * In the previous key locking protocol repeatable read and phantom 
     * protection is guaranteed by locking a range of keys in the btree.
     * The range is defined by the key previous to the first key you look
     * at and all subsequent keys you look at.  The first key in the index
     * is a special case, as there are no keys previous to it.  In that
     * case a special key is declared the "previous key" to the first key
     * in the btree and is locked instead.
     * <p>
     * In this implementation that first key is defined to be in the base
     * container, page ContainerHandle.FIRST_PAGE_NUMBER, record id 
     * PREVIOUS_KEY_HANDLE.
     * <p>
     * Note that the previous key is the same for all indexes on a given
     * conglomerate.  It seemed better for all locks on a base table to have
     * the same containerid, rather than having some locks generated from 
     * a btree have a containerid from base table and some having a containerid
     * from the btree.  If this turns out to be a problem we could either
     * have 2 different containerid's, be more creative with the record id, or
     * even add more to the lock key.

     *                          routine has to wait on the lock.
