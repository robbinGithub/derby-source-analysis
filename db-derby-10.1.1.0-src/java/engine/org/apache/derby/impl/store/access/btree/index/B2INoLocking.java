/**

Secondary index locking policy that does no locking.
<p>
This is used when the caller knows that logical locks are already obtained 
so need not be requested again.  For instance when inserting a row into
an index, a X row lock has already been obtained when the row was inserted
into the base table, so there is no need to get another lock in the 
secondary index.
<p>
This class overrides all interfaces of BTreeLockingPolicy making them
no-ops.
