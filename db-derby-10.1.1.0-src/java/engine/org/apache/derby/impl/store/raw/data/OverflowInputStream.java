        We might want to use the mode and isolation level of the container.
        This would have the advantage that, if the isolation level
        is READ_COMMITTED, resources would be freed if blobs/clob finalizers are
        called (e.g. they are garbage collected) before the end of transaction.
        If the mode was MODE_CONTAINER, openContainer would get an S lock on the
        table instead of an IS lock, and lockRecordForRead would have no effect.

        To do this, need to consider:
        Sometimes the container's locking policy may NOT reflect the correct
        locking policy. For example, if the container is a table (not an index)
        and Access handles the locking of the table via an index, the container's
        locking policy would be set to do no locking.
        Moreover, if the container is an index, the locking policy would
        always be set to do no locking.
