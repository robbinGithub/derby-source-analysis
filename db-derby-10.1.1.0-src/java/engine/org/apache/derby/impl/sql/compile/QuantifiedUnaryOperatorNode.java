/**
 * A QuantifiedUnaryOperatorNode represents a unary quantified predicate
 * that is used with a subquery, such as EXISTS and NOT EXISTS.  Quantified
 * predicates all return Boolean values.  All quantified operators will be
 * removed from the tree by the time we get to code generation - they will
 * be replaced by other constructs that can be compiled. For example,
 * an EXISTS node may be converted to a type of join.
