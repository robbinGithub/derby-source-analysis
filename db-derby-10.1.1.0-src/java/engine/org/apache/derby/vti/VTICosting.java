/**
  *	VTICosting is the interface that the query optimizer uses
  * to cost VTIs.
  * 
  The methods on the interface provide the optimizer
  * with the following information:
  <UL> 
  <LI> the estimated number of rows returned by the VTI in a single instantiation.
  <LI> the estimated cost to instantiate and iterate through the VTI.
  <LI> whether or not the VTI can be instantiated multiple times within a single query execution
  </UL>
  * <P>
  * This class can only be used within an SQL-J statement.  Using the methods
  * in application-side Java code results in Exceptions being thrown.
  * <P>
  * <I>IBM Corp reserves the right to change, rename, or
  * remove this interface at any time.</I>
