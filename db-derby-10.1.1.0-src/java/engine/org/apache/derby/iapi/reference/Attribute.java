/**
	List of all connection (JDBC) attributes by the system.


	<P>
	This class exists for two reasons
	<Ol>
	<LI> To act as the internal documentation for the attributes. 
	<LI> To remove the need to declare a java static field for the attributes
	name in the protocol/implementation class. This reduces the footprint as
	the string is final and thus can be included simply as a String constant pool entry.
	</OL>
	<P>
	This class should not be shipped with the product.

	<P>
	This class has no methods, all it contains are String's which by
	are public, static and final since they are declared in an interface.
