        This class contains public statics that map directly
        to the new public statics in the jdbc 2.0 classes.
        By providing an intermediary class, we can use the
        same statics without having to import the jdbc 2.0 classes
        into other classes.


        <P>
        This class should not be shipped with the product.

        <P>
        This class has no methods, all it contains are constants
        are public, static and final since they are declared in an interface.
