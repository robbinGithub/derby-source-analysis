/**
	A provider is an object that others can build dependencies
	on.  Providers can themselves also be dependents and thus
	be invalid/revalidated in turn. Revalidating a provider may,
	as a side-effect, re-validate its dependents -- it is up to
	the implementation to determine the appropriate action.
