/**
 * AssertFailure is raised when an ASSERT check fails.
 * Because assertions are not used in production code,
 * are never expected to fail, and recovering from their
 * failure is expected to be hard, they are under
 * RuntimeException so that no one needs to list them
 * in their throws clauses.  An AssertFailure at the
 * outermost system level will result in system shutdown.

	 *

	 * if this error has another error associated with it,
	 * it is specified here. The 'outermost' error should be
	 * the most sever error; inner errors should be providing
