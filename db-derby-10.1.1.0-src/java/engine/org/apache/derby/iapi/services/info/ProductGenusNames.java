/**
  Holder class for cloudscape genus names.

  <P>
  A product genus defines a product's category (tools, DBMS etc). For
  some categories, Cloudscape ships more than one product. Each product,
  within the genus has a unique product species.

  <P>
  A correct run time environment should include at most one Cloudscape
  product of a given genus. This helps avoid situations in which the
  environment loads classes from more than one product. a user runs
  with a mix of classes from different

  <P>
  Please not that the list provided here serves to document product
  genus names and to facile consistent naming in code. Because the
  list of supported Cloudscape genus names will change with time, the
  code in this package does *NOT* restrict users to the product genus
  names listed here.
