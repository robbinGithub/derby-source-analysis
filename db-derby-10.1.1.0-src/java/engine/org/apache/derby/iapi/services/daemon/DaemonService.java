/** 

  A DaemonService provides a background service which is suitable for
  asynchronous I/O and general clean up.  It should not be used as a general
  worker thread for parallel execution.  A DaemonService can be subscribe to by
  many Serviceable objects and a DaemonService will call that object's
  performWork from time to time.  These performWork method is defined by the
  client object and should be well behaved - in other words, it should not take
  too long or hog too many resources or deadlock with anyone else.  And it
  cannot (should not) error out.
 
  <P>MT - all routines on the interface must be MT-safe.
