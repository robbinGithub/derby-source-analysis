/**
	Management of file resources within	a database. Suitable for jar
	files, images etc.

	<P>A file resource is identified by the pair (name,generationId).
	Name is an arbitrary String supplied by the caller. GenerationId
	is a non-repeating sequence number constructed by the database.
	Within a database a	(name,generationId) pair uniquely identifies
	a version of a file resource for all time. Newer generation
	numbers reflect newer versions of the file.

	<P>A database supports the concept of a designated current version
	of a fileResource. The management of the current version is
	transactional. The following rules apply
	<OL>
	<LI>Adding a FileResource makes the added version the current
	version
	<LI>Removing a FileResource removes the current version of the
	resource. After this operation the database holds no current
	version of the FileResoure.
	<LI>Replacing a FileResource removes the current version of the
	resource.
	</OL>
	
	<P>For the benefit of replication, a database optionally retains 
	historic versions of stored files. These old versions are
	useful when processing old transactions in the stage.
