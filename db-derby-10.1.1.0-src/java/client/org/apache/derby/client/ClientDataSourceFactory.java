/**
 * The data source factory currrently for ClientDataSource only. This factory will support XA and pooling-enabled data
 * sources in the future.
 * <p/>
 * This factory reconstructs a DERBY simple data source object when it is retrieved from JNDI. References are needed
 * since many naming services don't have the ability to store Java objects in their serialized form. When a data source
 * object is bound in this type of naming service the Reference for that object is actually stored by the JNDI
 * implementation, not the data source object itself.
 * <p/>
 * A JNDI administrator is responsible for making sure that both the object factory and data source implementation
 * classes provided by a JDBC driver vendor are accessible to the JNDI service provider at runtime.
 * <p/>
 * An object factory implements the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory interface. This interface contains a single method,
 * getObjectInstance, which is called by a JNDI service provider to reconstruct an object when that object is retrieved
 * from JNDI. A JDBC driver vendor should provide an object factory as part of their JDBC 2.0 product.

     * Reconstructs a ClientDataSource object from a JNDI data source reference.
     * <p/>
     * The getObjectInstance() method is passed a reference that corresponds to the object being retrieved as its first
     * parameter. The other parameters are optional in the case of JDBC data source objects. The object factory should
     * use the information contained in the reference to reconstruct the data source. If for some reason, a data source
     * object cannot be reconstructed from the reference, a value of null may be returned. This allows other object
     * factories that may be registered in JNDI to be tried. If an exception is thrown then no other object factories
     * are tried.
     *
     * @param refObj      The possibly null object containing location or reference information that can be used in
     *                    creating an object.
     * @param name        The name of this object relative to nameContext, or null if no name is specified.
     * @param nameContext Context relative to which the name parameter is specified, or null if name is relative to the
     *                    default initial context.
     * @param environment Possibly null environment that is used in creating the object.
